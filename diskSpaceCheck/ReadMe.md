****STEPS****

1. Create a shell script to check disk usage and send an email notification.
2. Make the script executable:
## chmod +x disk_space_check.sh
3. Set up a cron job to run the script at regular intervals. Edit your crontab using the following command:
## crontab -e

4. Add the following line to run the script every hour, for example:
## 0 * * * * /path/to/disk_space_check.sh

NOTE: Replace /path/to with the actual path to your script. This example will run the script at the beginning of every hour.
Please note that you should have a functioning mail server or mail relay configured on your system for the email notification to work. Additionally, you might need to adjust the df command if you're checking a different filesystem or partition.
